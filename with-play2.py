We're glad you like it, @tcab! By implementing the __enter__ and __exit__
methods of a class you can create define what happens when used with a with
expression. For NiceGUI elements, we pass it down to the default_slot
(https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/nicegui/element.py#L67-L72).
Slots are basically 1:1 representations of Vue slots. Thus, child elements are
not directly nested in a parent element, but its default slot. In the slot's
__enter__ and __exit__ method we keep track of the current "context",
represented with a slot stack:
https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/nicegui/slot.py#L19-L25. It
tracks the slot you're currently in. Finally, when creating a new element, it
finds it parent slot on the slot stack:
https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/nicegui/element.py#L50

write a python class Element which can hold a list of children. Implement the
'with' protocol by implementing the __enter__ and __exit__ methods so that the
class can be use in a 'with' statement e.g. `with Element():`. Keep a
combination of global variables and Element properties so that when each
subclass of Element is created inside a with statement, the Element __init__
method knows who the parent Element is and wires it up accordingly, so that each
element knows its children.
